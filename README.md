# prework-study-guide

## Description

I began this project in hopes to consolidate my understanding of website building tools such as Javascript, CSS and HTML through a study guide. This website solves the issue of scattered and unorganised notes that were taken, allowing me to list important information under clear subheadings. Through the development of this project, I learned of the important steps involved in ensuring that all branches and assets remain clear and concise so that the base website is easier to build upon and adjust as new ideas are formed and tasks are undertook
